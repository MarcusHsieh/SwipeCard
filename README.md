# SwipeCard.
Swiping into work has never been easier

## Inspiration
Inspired by a combination of BeReal and the gamification of studying. 

## What it does
The goal of SwipeCard is to encourage users to be productive while studying! By "clocking in" by swiping their card into the slot, they take a picture (with both front and back cameras) and initiate their study/work session. When the user "clocks out" they take their card out and take another picture (again, with both front and back cameras) and the app will record their session. 

## How we built it
We didn't implement the app, but we designed a website that advertises the app and its features. 

The website was designed in Figma and partially implemented into an interactive React webpage.

## Challenges we ran into
This is our first "Designathon" and we were put to the test to create a website with the users in mind. We wanted to make the website intuitive, easy to read, and engaging. It was a challenging task to include all the content we wanted while ensuring all the frames were properly and evenly laid out. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating a website while keeping the user in mind! 

## What we learned
We became much more comfortable working in Figma and implementing a Figma design into an interactive website.
